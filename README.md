# Cloud Yourself
Cloud Yourself is a self service portal with an automation backend and corresponding APIs to handle decentral managed cloud accounts containing independend workloads in enterprise environments. It helps employees with and without any cloud know how to easily create cloud accounts and to deploy decentral managed workloads but still ensuring that all enterprise compliance and security requirements are met.

## Goals
At Continental we started this project internally with the goal to improve the overall accessibility to the cloud for each employee and the hole company. Read more of the goals we want to achive with this system and the capabiliteis we plan to realize in the [Wiki](https://github.com/continental/cloud-yourself/wiki) of this project.

## Current Status
Cloud Yourself is currently in a very early development stage. We are currently working on two MVPs to prove that the overall idea and the vision for our [Self Service](https://github.com/continental/cloud-yourself/wiki/capability-self-service) and [Distributed Billing](https://github.com/continental/cloud-yourself/wiki/Capability-Distributed-Billing) capability is realizeable. There the system is not yet ready for productive use cases.
