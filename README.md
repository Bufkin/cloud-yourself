# Cloud Yourself
Cloud Yourself is a self service portal with an automation backend and corresponding APIs to handle decentral managed cloud accounts containing independend workloads in enterprise environments. It helps employees with and without any cloud know how to easily create cloud accounts and to deploy decentral managed workloads but still ensuring that all enterprise compliance and security requirements are met.

## Capabilities

There are currently two capabilities in focus of Cloud Yourself:

**1. Self Service**
   With the Self Service capability Cloud Yourself allows enterprise employees to create, modify and delete cloud resources in a managed environment which ensures that guardrails of the company are always met.
   
**2. Distributed Billing**
   With the Distributed Billing capability Cloud Yourself automates the distibution of costs to internal cost centers accoarding to the costs-by-cause principle.
   
## Current Status
Cloud Yourself is currently in a very early development stage. We started this project internally with the goal to improve the overall accessibility to the cloud for each employee and the hole company. If you like this idea everyone is welcome to support us in our further development.
